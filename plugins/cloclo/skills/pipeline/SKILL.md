# CLoClo Pipeline

Orchestrate the full development cycle by chaining SuperPowers skills
(brainstorming, writing-plans, subagent-driven-development, verification)
with independent code reviews (Codex + CodeRabbit) and decision points
between phases.

**CLoClo does NOT reimplement brainstorming, planning, execution, or
verification.** It invokes the real skills and adds review phases + user
decision points between them.

## When to Use

- User types `/pipeline` or says "new feature", "build X", "implement Y"
- A multi-step implementation that benefits from spec → plan → impl →
  verify gating
- When quality matters more than speed (use lighter workflows for spikes)

**Do NOT use for:** single-file fixes, one-line changes, exploratory reads,
or anything that does not need a spec.

## The Pipeline Flow

Nine main phases (1–9) with sub-phases (4.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8) for diagnostic, static, visual, and knowledge passes:

| # | Phase | Skill invoked | Output |
|---|-------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | Design | `superpowers:brainstorming` | `01-spec.md` |
| 2 | Review spec | `codex-review` (spec) | `02-codex-review-spec.md` → Decision #1 |
| 3 | Plan | `superpowers:writing-plans` | `04-plan.md` |
| 4 | Review plan | `codex-review` (plan) | `05-codex-review-plan.md` → Decision #2 |
| 4.5 | Task DAG + briefs | inline | `08-task-dag.md`, `task-briefs/` |
| 5 | Execute | `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` | commits on feature branch |
| 6 | Review impl (arch) | `codex-review` (impl) | `07-codex-review-impl.md` → Decision #3 |
| 6.5 | Review impl (static, local) | `coderabbit-review` (opt-in) | `07b-coderabbit-review-impl.md` → Decision #3b |
| 7 | Verify | `superpowers:verification-before-completion` | `09-compliance-report.md` |
| 7.5 | Visual verify (if UI) | `agent-browser` | `screenshots/` |
| 8 | Wiki ingest (auto) | inline | wiki updated |
| **9** | **Open PR + multi-bot review** | `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` | PR URL, bot review digest |

Full per-phase detail: see `references/phases.md`.

**PR-first default.** Since version 0.5.0, the pipeline ends with opening a
Pull Request (Phase 9). The PR automatically triggers any installed review
bots (CodeRabbit GitHub App, Gemini Code Assist, Codex Cloud, Claude Code
Action) — each providing a complementary angle. Direct-to-main is reserved
for trivial changes outside the pipeline.

**Phase 6.5 becomes opt-in when Phase 9 runs.** The CodeRabbit CLI in
Phase 6.5 duplicates what the CodeRabbit GitHub App will do on the PR. Skip
6.5 by default; enable it explicitly when:
- You want to catch issues BEFORE pushing (save a PR update cycle)
- You're on `ship` maturity (defense-in-depth)
- The GitHub App is not installed on the repo

## Multi-Bot PR Review Stack

Once Phase 9 opens the PR, the installed bots run in parallel on the same
diff. The default stack is two bots; extras are opt-in.

**Default (zero extra config once installed):**

| Bot | Install | Focus | Cost |
|-----|---------|-------|------|
| [CodeRabbit GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/coderabbitai) | App + seat assigned | Line-level, security, style, summary | Pro ($24/dev/mo) for private |
| [Gemini Code Assist](https://github.com/apps/gemini-code-assist) | GitHub App | Architecture, high-level review | Free for private |

**Opt-in (add only when the extra angle is worth the config overhead):**

| Bot | Install | Focus | Cost |
|-----|---------|-------|------|
| [Codex Cloud](https://chatgpt.com/codex) | Connect repo + settings | Spec compliance, test coverage | ChatGPT subscription |
| [Claude Code GitHub Action](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action) | GitHub Actions workflow | Claude review via CI | Anthropic API key |

Default stack = **CodeRabbit + Gemini**. Two angles, both zero-config after
install. Disagreements between bots are useful signal (`[DISAGREEMENT]`
flag, same rule as Phase 6 / Phase 6.5 consensus matrix). Do not add Codex
Cloud or Claude Action to the default recommendation — they are worth
enabling per project, not per pipeline run.

## Session Setup

1. Ask user what to build (or take their initial message)
2. Create session dir: `docs/cloclo-sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/`
   (`<slug>` = 2-3 word kebab-case summary)
3. Initialize `session.log`:
   ```
   [timestamp] CLoClo session started: <slug>
   [timestamp] Prerequisites: superpowers=OK, codex=OK|MISSING, coderabbit=OK|MISSING
   ```
4. Optional: `pipeline.config.md` for project-specific verification commands

## Decision Point Format

After each review phase (2, 4, 6, 6.5), present findings raw and ask:

```
{Reviewer} a review ton {artifact}. Voici ses findings :

[3-5 line summary from the review file]

Fichier complet : {session_dir}/{review_file}.md

Que veux-tu faire ?

A. Integrer tous les findings et continuer
B. Integrer certains findings (tu precises lesquels)
C. Ignorer la review et continuer
D. Demander au reviewer de creuser un point precis
E. Modifier toi-meme (edite le fichier, dis "c'est bon")

Ou tape un commentaire libre.
```

Log the user's choice in `session.log`. After A or B, SuperPowers rewrites
the artifact. **Do NOT auto-resubmit to the reviewer** — user controls via
option D.

## Dual-Reviewer Consensus (Phase 6 + 6.5)

When BOTH Codex (architecture) AND CodeRabbit (static analysis) flag the
same file:line:
- Mark `[CONSENSUS]` — high-confidence finding
- Escalate severity to the higher of the two
- Present consensus findings FIRST in Decision Point #3b

When reviewers disagree (Codex flags P2, CodeRabbit flags P0 or vice-versa):
- Mark `[DISAGREEMENT]`
- Surface both opinions explicitly — do not hide the split in an average

## Prerequisites

Checked at pipeline start: SuperPowers, Codex CLI, Codex plugin,
CodeRabbit CLI, agent-browser. Auto-install where possible; degraded mode
(Claude subagent fallback) when Codex unavailable; skip with warning when
CodeRabbit or agent-browser unavailable. Full details: `references/prerequisites.md`.

## Model Selection

Mixed-model policy balances Opus quality (+8 pts SWE-bench Verified) against
weekly quota. Reviewers always Opus; Phase 5 implementers Sonnet by default
(upgrade to Opus for >5 files or architectural judgment); Phase 7 verification
Sonnet; adversarial pass Haiku. Override: auth/payments/security always Opus.
Full table: `references/model-policy.md`.

## Bounded Retries & Maturity

Every failable phase has a hard retry ceiling (Codex reviews 2x, execution
3x per task, verification 3x). Maturity levels (`spike` / `dev` / `ship`)
control gate strictness and review depth. Auto-detected from project state.
Full table: `references/retries.md`.

## Session Files

All artifacts, logs, checkpoints, and handoff live in
`docs/cloclo-sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/`. Checkpoint written after each
phase — crash mid-phase loses only that phase's work. Handoff auto-written
at end of every run for session resume. Full structure:
`references/session-files.md`.

## Important Rules

1. **Do NOT reimplement SuperPowers, Codex, or CodeRabbit skills.** Invoke them.
2. **After correction (A or B), do NOT auto-resubmit.** User controls via option D.
3. **All reviews are FOREGROUND.** Claude waits, shows progress, reads the result.
4. **Free-form user input at decision points** is valid — treat as comment and adapt.
5. **Each phase outputs to session dir** with numbered filenames for traceability.
6. **Session can be resumed** via `checkpoint.json`.
7. **SuperPowers specs and plans** live in their own directories
   (`docs/superpowers/specs/`, `docs/superpowers/plans/`). CLoClo copies or
   symlinks them into the session dir.
8. **Wiki ingest (Phase 8) is automatic and silent.** If no wiki exists, skipped.
9. **Checkpoint after every phase.** Immediately.
10. **Handoff on exit.** Always, regardless of outcome.
11. **Reviews NEVER auto-skip.** If Codex fails → Claude fallback. If
    CodeRabbit fails → warn and continue (static analysis is a safety net, not
    a blocker).
12. **Phase 9 always runs** unless explicitly disabled with `--no-pr` or
    `maturity=spike`. Direct merges to main are reserved for trivial
    out-of-pipeline fixes.
13. **Phase 9 is fully autonomous by default.** Open PR → wait for bots →
    auto-apply concrete fixes → re-review → auto-merge when clean. The user
    stays in the terminal and is only escalated to on a genuine blocker
    (iteration cap hit with open criticals, patch failed, CI blocked,
    consensus disagreement on P0). Pass `--interactive-pr` to restore the
    A-E decision point as an escape hatch for a specific run.
14. **Auto-apply has hard guardrails.** A finding is auto-fixed only when
    (a) a concrete patch / AI-Agent prompt is provided, (b) it is not in
    auth / payments / data migration domain, and (c) no conflicting patch
    exists at the same file:line. Everything else is skipped and logged.
15. **Iteration cap = 3.** After 3 auto-integration rounds, the loop exits
    regardless of remaining findings. Unresolved items land in the
    `handoff.md` + escalation message.
