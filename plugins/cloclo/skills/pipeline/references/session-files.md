**Runtime logs**: each review (codex-review, glm-review) writes its stderr/process output to `{output_file}.runtime.log` as a sibling of the review file. The review content itself lives in the `.md` file. If a review fails (empty file), the runtime log is the first place to look for diagnostics.

## Session Log Format

One line per event. Timestamps are ISO 8601 UTC.

```

## Checkpoint Format

Written to `{session_dir}/checkpoint.json` after each phase succeeds:

```json
{
  "session": "2026-04-16-auth-refactor",
  "maturity": "dev",
  "last_completed_phase": 4,
  "last_completed_at": "2026-04-16T15:22:00Z",
  "artifacts": {
    "spec": "03-spec-v2.md",
    "plan": "04-plan.md",
    "base_ref": "a1b2c3d",
    "commits": []
  },
  "decisions": {
    "1": {"choice": "A", "at": "2026-04-16T14:55:30Z"},
    "2": {"choice": "B", "details": "integrate 1,3 only", "at": "2026-04-16T15:22:30Z"}
  },
  "retries": {"phase_2": 0, "phase_4": 0, "phase_6_5": 0}
}
```

### Resume Behavior

On pipeline start, if `checkpoint.json` exists in session dir:
1. Show: `"Resuming session \"{slug}\" from Phase {N+1}. Last completed: Phase {N} at {time}."`
2. Ask: `"Reprendre a partir de Phase {N+1} ? (oui/non/restart)"`
3. `oui` → skip to Phase N+1 with checkpoint artifacts
4. `restart` → delete checkpoint, start from Phase 1
5. `non` → ask what to do

A crash mid-phase only loses that phase's work, not the entire session.

## Handoff Format

Auto-written to `{session_dir}/handoff.md` at end of every run (success or failure):

```markdown
# Session Handoff: {slug}

## Status: {COMPLETED | FAILED_AT_PHASE_N | PARTIAL}

## What was done
- [completed phases with key outcomes]
- Commits: {commit_list}

## What is blocked (if any)
- [phase that failed + reason]
- [unresolved review findings]

## Next recommended action
- [specific next step]

## Key decisions made
- Decision #1: {choice} — {reason}
- Decision #2: {choice} — {reason}

## Files to read for context
- Spec: {path}
- Plan: {path}
- Reviews: {paths}
```

This enables a new Claude session to pick up where the previous left off by
reading `handoff.md` instead of replaying the entire conversation.
