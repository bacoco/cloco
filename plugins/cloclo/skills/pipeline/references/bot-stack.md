# Multi-Bot PR Review Stack (Phase 9)

Once Phase 9 opens the PR, installed bots run in parallel on the same
diff. The default stack is two bots; extras are opt-in.

## Default (zero extra config once installed)

| Bot | Install | Focus | Cost |
|-----|---------|-------|------|
| [CodeRabbit GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/coderabbitai) | App + seat assigned | Line-level, security, style, summary | Pro ($24/dev/mo) for private |
| [Gemini Code Assist](https://github.com/apps/gemini-code-assist) | GitHub App | Architecture, high-level review | Free for private |

## Opt-in (add only when the extra angle is worth the config overhead)

| Bot | Install | Focus | Cost |
|-----|---------|-------|------|
| [Codex Cloud](https://chatgpt.com/codex) | Connect repo + settings | Spec compliance, test coverage | ChatGPT subscription |
| [Claude Code GitHub Action](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action) | GitHub Actions workflow | Claude review via CI | Anthropic API key |

Default stack = **CodeRabbit + Gemini**. Two angles, both zero-config
after install.

## Consensus Amplification

When BOTH Codex (architecture) AND CodeRabbit (static analysis) flag the
same file:line:
- Mark `[CONSENSUS]` — high-confidence finding
- Escalate severity to the higher of the two
- Apply during Phase 6.5 auto-integration (consensus beats the 3-gate
  skip)

## Disagreement Handling

When reviewers disagree (Codex flags P2, CodeRabbit flags P0 or vice-
versa):
- Mark `[DISAGREEMENT]`
- If severity spread > 1 level AND the higher is `critical` → escalate
- Otherwise apply the higher-severity fix and log the disagreement

No averaging, no hiding the split.

## Auto-Integration (the 3 gates)

A bot finding is auto-applied only when ALL three gates pass:

1. **Concrete patch available.** Bot provided a diff block or AI-Agent
   prompt with file:line + replacement. Pure judgment-only findings
   ("consider refactoring X") skipped.
2. **Not auth / payments / data migration domain.** Escalate instead.
3. **No conflicting patches across bots.** Different fixes at same
   file:line → skip both, log `[CONFLICT]`.

Iteration cap: 3. After cap, exit and log remaining findings.
